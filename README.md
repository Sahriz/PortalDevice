# Portals

## Overview
This project is one where I create portals in Unity, currently it works for both 1st- and 3rd-person portals, but needs alot of fine tuning to look good. 

## 1st-person Portals

## 3rd-person Portals

Some more obvious issues that have become more apparent in the 3rd-person portals is for example the player clipping through the portals and showing through it, and also the shadows not rendering to the other side of it. Also the player looks very glitchy on the other side of the portal, which is not to clear right now why that might be, but I am working on it!
